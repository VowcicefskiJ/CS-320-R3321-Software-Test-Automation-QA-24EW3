What We Set Out to Do

My mission To make a go-to app for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments that's super easy to use. We wanted something straightforward, without the bells and whistles, that just gets the job done.


The Hurdles Along the Way

One of the biggest puzzles we had to solve was figuring out how to stop our app from letting you set appointments in the past. But it actually took us a good chunk of time and a lot of Googling. We ended up using Java's Calendar and Date classes, which was a bit of a brain teaser but super satisfying once we got it working.


How We Worked Together

We used Git and GitHub to keep our code in check, which meant we could work on different bits at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. We had regular catch-ups on Zoom and kept a Slack channel going for all the quick questions, memes, and, of course, panic moments.


The Cool Stuff We Learned

This project was like a crash course in Java and JUnit for us. We got to grips with:

Java's OOP Magic: Classes, objects, inheritance â€“ you name it, we coded it.
JUnit Wizardry: Writing tests that actually help and not just because we have to.
Real-World Problem-Solving: Like figuring out that pesky past appointment issue.


Feedback & Looking Ahead

Feed back pointed out some areas we hadn't even thought of, like making the user interface friendlier(That we never really needed for the assignment). We're already sketching out ideas for version 2.0, maybe even syncing up with Google Calendar to level up our app.


Wrapping It Up

Looking back, we're pretty stoked about what we've built and how much we've learned along the way. Sure, there were moments we wanted to throw our computers out the window, but hitting those breakthrough moments made it all worth it.
