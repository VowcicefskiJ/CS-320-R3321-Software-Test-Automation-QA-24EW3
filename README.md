What We're Doing

To make managing contacts, tasks, and appointments as easy as pie. No databases needed hereâ€”we're keeping it simple and focusing on what matters: functionality and reliability.

Why We Started This

We wanted to tackle something that could make a real difference in our daily routines. Think about it: who doesn't need a little help keeping track of all the people, tasks, and meetings in their life? Plus, we saw this as a perfect chance to get our hands dirty with Java and learn more about unit testing with JUnit. It's all about making something practical that we, and hopefully others, will actually use.

Cool Features We're Adding

Contact Keeper: Save, update, and delete contact info without breaking a sweat.
Task Tracker: Got tasks? We'll help you keep track of them, add new ones, and cross off the done deals.
Appointment Assistant: Schedule your appointments without the fear of double-booking or missing a meeting because it was set in the past.

Our Learning Curve

We're not just coding; we're learning the ropes of building something from scratch that's both useful and reliable. Using JUnit to test our app means we're making sure everything works just right and catching any bugs early. We're aiming for that sweet spot of 80% test coverage to make sure our app is as bug-free as possible.

Who We Think Will Love This

Honestly? Anyone who's ever felt overwhelmed by keeping track of their personal or work life (so, basically everyone!). We're building this app with the hope that it'll make life a little easier, whether you're a student like us, a busy professional, or just someone trying to stay organized.

What's Next for Us

We're just getting started! Based on what everyone thinks and the feedback we get, we're ready to tweak, adjust, and add new features. We're thinking about syncing with calendars, adding security features, and maybe even making it work across different platforms.
